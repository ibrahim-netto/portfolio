The project includes a real-time, in-situ agricultural internet of things (IoT) device designed to monitor the state of the soil and the environment. This device was designed to be compatible with open hardware and it is composed of temperature and humidity sensors (soil and environment), electrical conductivity of the soil and luminosity, Global Positioning System (GPS) and a ZigBee radio for data communication.

For the monitoring device construction, the developed software used Node.js platform as base, with a Raspberry PI connected to all the sensors, the mesh network interface and a custom circuit board.

For the central communication with all monitoring devices, the Koa framework was used together with a custom communication protocol over Zigbee, components of Semantic UI and Highcharts for the data visualization front-end and MongoDB as database.
